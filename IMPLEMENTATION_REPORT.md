# Shelf Decor, draft deletion, and refresh recovery

Implemented sequentially: Shelf Decor and its tests first, draft deletion and its tests second, then refresh recovery and integration/regression checks. Tests use temporary lab directories; existing application data and running user servers were not modified or restarted.

1. **Shelf Decor architecture:** a separate shelf-level collection, with shared rendering in `shelf_model.js` and editor interactions in `shelf_decor.js`. Decor never becomes a bin, lab-map item, storage location, or searchable inventory field.
2. **Shapes:** rectangle/square, ellipse/circle, and triangle, with unique IDs within each shelf.
3. **Position and size:** zero-based shelf-cell coordinates, quarter-cell snapping, drag movement, a bottom-right resize handle, and numeric size/position fields. Minimum dimensions are 0.25 cells; out-of-bounds and invalid dimensions are rejected. Movement is committed on pointer-up, using the current canvas dimensions, including after zoom.
4. **Storage:** an optional `decor` array in the existing shelf document. It travels through the existing draft, export/import, copy, named-save, and version-snapshot mechanisms.
5. **Modes:** Simple shelves show the decor canvas without inventory bins; Complex shelves show both. Mode switches preserve all decor and dormant bins.
6. **View Only:** the same renderer displays shapes without interactive handles or editing controls. Bins remain above decor and retain hover tooltips. In the editor, covered decor is selectable through the sidebar; disabling canvas decor editing allows empty-cell selection beneath shapes.
7. **Draft deletion:** Manage drafts lists temporary working copies from the current authenticated session, across tabs. Delete Draft opens a confirmation dialog with Cancel and a red destructive button. Closing or canceling the dialog does not delete anything.
8. **Active/final draft:** active deletion loads the latest committed document, clears selection and undo/redo state, and leaves no active cached working copy. Deleting the final draft produces an empty list. New shelf drafts return to blank shelf data when the parent map draft still contains the shelf; nonexistent shelves return to the lab.
9. **Deletion storage:** removal occurs in the existing server RAM draft cache and in the matching localStorage recovery entry. Session-scoped deletion counters reject late writes and stale browser snapshots. No committed JSON or version-history file is deleted. The existing application has no on-disk draft database; its temporary-session semantics are retained.
10. **Refresh recovery:** each meaningful edit writes a browser safety copy immediately, while the existing delayed server cache continues normally. Pending text changes are flushed through normal field handlers before refresh. Authentication, recovery, document hydration, and finally enabling editing happen in that order.
11. **Mechanism:** one localStorage record per working document, containing current data, dirty/pending flags, recovery metadata, and useful UI context. The browser copy does not duplicate the complete undo stack; the server still keeps up to 40 undo/redo steps.
12. **Scope:** browser origin, server-provided project and login-session hashes, tab instance, and lab/shelf resource. New map recovery happens before shelf recovery so newly added shelves remain accessible.
13. **Stale/corrupt protection:** format, timestamp, eight-hour expiry, committed lab revision, document revision, and deletion counter are checked. Pending documents pass the existing server draft validation before hydration. Invalid or stale browser records are ignored; older server working copies are not allowed to overwrite newer committed data on refresh.
14. **Save Changes:** only the existing explicit named-save flow commits versions. On success, committed browser copies are cleared, the returned lab revision becomes the recovery baseline, and any edits made during the save remain dirty. Failed commits keep the recovery copy.
15. **Logout:** intentional logout clears browser recovery for the login session and uses existing server-session invalidation to discard its drafts. Visitor mode loads committed data. Recovery does not grant authentication or publish private edits.
16. **Important files:** `shelf_model.js`, `shelf_decor.js`, `shelf.js`, `shelf_editor.html`, `explorer.js`, and `editor.css` implement decor; `draft_manager.js` and `server.py` implement deletion; `editor_recovery.js`, `common.js`, `lab.js`, and `map_editor.js` integrate recovery. Both editor pages load the new scripts. `README.md` documents behavior and deployment.
17. **Schema/API changes:** optional decor objects contain `id`, `shape`, `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `text`, `outlineWidth`, `outlineColor`, `fillColor`, and `textColor`. Existing shelf files need no migration. New authenticated APIs expose the draft list, delete a specific working copy, and provide recovery context. Draft-epoch and committed-lab-revision headers coordinate deletion and saves without changing saved file schemas.
18. **Tests added/updated:** `test_shelf_decor.py`, `test_draft_deletion.py`, `browser_decor.py`, `browser_drafts.py`, and `browser_recovery.py` cover the new behavior. Existing Simple Shelf and resize-message expectations were updated. `run_browser_suite.py` runs distinct browser tests once instead of repeating inherited tests.
19. **Executed workflows:** Chromium automation exercised shape creation, movement, resizing, outline/text changes, deleting/undoing decor, Simple/Complex switches, fractional bins, bin and shelf copying, named saves, version restores, logout/login, read-only hover, confirmed/canceled draft deletion, active/last/cross-tab deletion, immediate refresh, unsent map/shelf changes, failed saves, stale/corrupt recovery, and storage failure. Editor and read-only screenshots were visually inspected. These were browser-automated workflows, not a separate human manual test session.
20. **Limitations:** recovery protects an active authenticated session; server restart/session expiry still ends that session. Save or export before restarting or intentionally logging out. Browser recovery restores current data, not an unsent full undo history. Selections are cleared on refresh. localStorage capacity can limit emergency copies; failures warn and retain the existing server-cache path. Browser checks used Chromium; Firefox and Safari were not tested.

## Validation commands

Executed successfully: **23 server tests**, **52 distinct browser tests**, and the **standalone browser smoke workflow**. After the final save-response adjustment, the **7 recovery/decor browser tests** and **23 server tests** were rerun successfully. `git diff --check` also passed. Browser fixtures collect runtime/console errors; the intentional failed-save test excludes only its simulated HTTP 503 message.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 tests/run_browser_suite.py
python3 tests/browser_smoke.py
```

Browser commands require Playwright and Chromium with its system libraries. Development used an isolated `.venv` and local extracted browser dependencies.
