# Visual inventory implementation and verification

Completed October 4, 2026. The existing repository and current populated data were
the source of truth. The implementation extends the existing item/stock identities,
revision checks, save journal, audit history, layout editors and recovery tools.
No runtime dependency or second inventory store was introduced.

## Completed behavior

- Name-only presence entry from Simple shelves and selected Complex bins, using
  Enter or Add; focus remains ready for the next entry. Optional details edit the
  same entry and preserve unknown quantities/prices. Failures retain the name;
  composition, duplicate submissions, stale revisions and uncertain saves are handled.
- Compact shelf panels with actual selectable bin/decor previews, separate shelf
  and selected-bin stock, keyboard/touch selection, and a separate structural editor.
- Visual destination selection in LAB INVENTORY, including tables, machines and
  carts. Switching destinations preserves form fields. Stable object IDs retain
  inventory through movement, renaming, removal and layout restoration.
- One-time current-bin contents conversion, including dormant and unplaced files;
  contents/keyword fields retired from active bin editing. Original text remains
  recoverable. Imports/restores cannot convert historical prose into duplicate stock.
- Item-ID map highlighting of every mapped destination, matching bins, temporary
  filter reveal, unrelated-object dimming and explicit clear/visibility restoration.
- Selectable blank placeholder bins display as “empty”; custom names, descriptions,
  review text and inventory remain meaningful regardless of geometry or visual style.
- Anonymous shelf reports with optional bin context, retained failed text, duplicate
  protection, validation and throttling; persistent private admin review, pending
  count, location navigation, resolution and dismissal.

Stage-specific checks were completed before continuing to each subsequent feature.
The stage record is [INVENTORY_STAGES.md](INVENTORY_STAGES.md).

## Applied migration and preservation

The populated-data copy was validated before the real upgrade. The real migration
completed at **2026-10-04 07:38 UTC**, using the normal checkpointed server startup
path. No failure, deletion or restoration tests were performed on populated live data.

- **94 presence entries converted; 0 duplicate assignments skipped; 0 review cases.**
- The original **1 item and 2 stock records** are unchanged, including all details.
  The inventory now has **95 items and 96 stock records**, at revision **5** (was 4).
- All **84 retained shelf files** keep their identities, names, revisions, geometry,
  decor and styles. Only retired bin text and its recovery metadata changed.
- The saved lab layout, defaults and every pre-existing layout/inventory history
  file remain byte-for-byte unchanged. A new inventory audit snapshot records revision 5.
- The migration marker and source/status records are in
  `data/bin-contents-migration.json`; keep this with inventory during backup/recovery.

Recoverable checkpoints in `.itr-backups/`:

- `before-visual-inventory-20261003T195647Z.tar.gz` — pre-implementation data/defaults.
- `before-final-migration-20261004T073857Z.tar.gz` — immediately before applying the upgrade.
- `before-final-migration-20261004T073857Z-sha256.json` — hashes of all 124 protected files.
- `before-bin-contents-20261004T073857-4499bd54.tar.gz` — automatic migration checkpoint.

Preservation results are recorded in `.itr-backups/final-migration-verification.json`.
Full lab backup/recovery now includes the migration marker/source record and saved
anonymous reports, in addition to inventory, layout, defaults and both histories.

## Final verification

- **41 backend tests passed** with `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
- **70 distinct browser tests passed** with `.venv/bin/python tests/run_browser_suite.py`.
- The standalone browser smoke test passed, covering the existing editing, dragging,
  authorization, draft recovery, named saves, undo/redo, reload and restore workflows.
- An additional browser check on a **disposable populated-data copy** confirmed
  migrated entries render, clicking shelf/bin and entering a name stays focused,
  LAB INVENTORY shares that entry, the admin migration summary appears, and all
  existing records remain unchanged.
- ESLint, Prettier, Python compilation and `git diff --check` passed.

Focused checks cover detailed record preservation, migration reruns/interruption,
old imports/restores, copy isolation, unmapped stock, physical object destinations,
filter restoration, item-ID isolation, keyboard, emulated touch/narrow screens,
concurrent revisions, lost acknowledgements, failed refreshes and private report
authorization/persistence. Legacy browser expectations were updated for the new
compact UI while retaining their structural and stock-preservation assertions.

Logs are retained under `.itr-backups/final-{backend,browser,smoke,populated-browser}.log`.
The populated preview screenshot is `.itr-backups/populated-map-preview.png`.
Checks used the existing virtual environment/Playwright, the available sibling
development Node/npm tools, and extracted Chromium libraries under
`.itr-backups/verification-tools/`; no system package installation was needed.

## Operational limits

Start the updated server normally with `python3 server.py`. The migration has already
been applied; the marker prevents another conversion. Save/export active layout
drafts before restarting any old process, since authenticated sessions and backend
drafts are held in memory. This application supports one server process per data directory.

Inline quick-entry text survives failures while its panel remains open, but unsaved
typing does not persist across reloads. Detailed inventory forms retain their existing
session/tab recovery. A shared admin login and whole-inventory revision checks remain;
concurrent edits can require refreshing/review. Other tabs receive update signals;
other browsers can use Refresh inventory. Full backups cover saved data, not private
unsaved drafts. Browser verification used Chromium and emulated mobile/touch; separate
Firefox, Safari and real-device verification was not performed.
